** cl_toy.dat
   Just a powerlaw for C(l), based on nothing.

** gcov_out.dat
   Gaussian covariance matrix generated from the COV_MATRIX file (input matrix).

** lncovmatrix.dat
   3x3 symmetric positive-definite matrix that also leads to a gaussian matrix 
   with the same properties.

** means.dat 
   File containing the 3 means of the variables described by the input matrix.

** ps_test_grf.dat
   C(l) of convergence in log bins, computed using Limber's approximation. 
   See ps_test_grf.README for more details.

** ps_test_grf.README
   Information about ps_test_grf.dat sent from Benjamin Joachimi 
   to Henrique Xavier via email.

** shifts.dat
   3 shifts (one for each variable) of the lognormal distribution. This is 
   ignored if distribution is gaussian. -shift is the minimum value reached 
   by the distribution.
