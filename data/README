** cl_toy.dat
   Just a powerlaw for C(l), based on nothing.

** gcov_out.dat
   Gaussian covariance matrix generated from the COV_MATRIX file (input matrix).

** lncovmatrix.dat
   3x3 symmetric positive-definite matrix that also leads to a gaussian matrix 
   with the same properties.

** means.dat 
   File containing the 3 means of the variables described by the input matrix.

** ps_test_grf.dat
   C(l) of convergence in log bins, computed using Limber's approximation. 
   See ps_test_grf.README for more details.

** ps_test_grf.README
   Information about ps_test_grf.dat sent from Benjamin Joachimi 
   to Henrique Xavier via email.

** shifts.dat
   3 shifts (one for each variable) of the lognormal distribution. This is 
   ignored if distribution is gaussian. -shift is the minimum value reached 
   by the distribution.

** Cf_z_f_z_.dat
   These are C(l)s (angular power spectrum) for two fields at two different redshifts.
   These files are actually just ps_test_grf.dat multiplied by elements of a covariance 
   matrix between all fields and redshifts. Since this matrix is the same for all l, 
   the covariance between the fields and redshifts at all ls are the same.
