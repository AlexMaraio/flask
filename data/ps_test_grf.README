attached is an ascii file with two columns, 1: angular frequency; 2: convergence power spectrum. I have output it for 200 bins in a range that should cover your needs.

Notes: you can treat angular frequency as multipole. Logarithmic binning is hard-coded in my code, so I could not produce integer ell for you. This means that, upon reading this data in, you will have to do interpolation to get the power spectrum values at integer ell (log-linear interpolation should be just fine). That's a useful step to have in the code anyway because the power spectra are so smooth that writing them for every ell is very inefficient. Also, my code uses Limber's approximation, so that this power spectrum will not be accurate for the smallest ell (<50 or so). This does not matter right now as your code should make a random field irrespective of how the input power spectra look like (as long as they have roughly the same shape and smoothness as the 'real' ones we want to use in the end, which is the case).
