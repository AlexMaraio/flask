# - This is a config file for the program corrlnfields.             #
# - Program parameters are identified by the colon that follows it  #
#   (so do not use it for anything else!).                          #
# - Parameters must be followed by their values which can be a      #
#   string or a sequence of up to 3 int, double or char variables.  #
#   Such sequences cannot mix different types.                      #
# - Any other simbol or position of keywords and text are           #
#   completely arbitrary and chosen for aesthetic reasons.          #
#                                                                   #
# - All parameters used by the program should be listed here since  # 
#   there are no hard-wired default values.                         #
# - Addition/removal/modification of parameters in this file must   #
#   be followed by a modification of ParDef namespace in the        #
#   ParameterList.hpp file.                                         #

### Simulation basics ###

DIST:            LOGNORMAL		          # Either LOGNORMAL or GAUSSIAN.
RNDSEED:         4     	  	       	          # Seed for random numbers.
WEIRDSKIP:       0                                # Skip transformation from lognormal to auxiliary gaussian C(l) -- 0 not to do it.

### Input data ###

CL_PREFIX:       ../data/Sreef                    # Prefix of the angular power spectrums Cij(l) to use.
MEANS_SHIFTS:    ../data/Sree-mean-shift.dat      # Means and shifts of fields. Shift column is irrelevant for GAUSSIAN.

### Angular moment calculations ### 

SUPPRESS_L:      350			          # l scale for exponential suppression of C(l) (to avoid oscillations in Xi).

LMIN:            2                                # Minimum l for which covariance matrices will be generated.
